Exercise 1.12. The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal's triangle.


The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it.35

Write a procedure that computes elements of Pascal's triangle by means of a recursive process. If a number lies outside of the triangle, return 0 (this makes sense if we view pascal as the combination function ). Start counting rows and columns from 0.
