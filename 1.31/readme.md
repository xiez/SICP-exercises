The sum procedure is only the simplest of a vast number of similar abstractions that can be captured as higher-order procedures.51 Write an analogous procedure called product that returns the product of the values of a function at points over a given range. Try both a recursive and an iterative approach. Show how to define factorial in terms of product. Also use product to compute approximations to using the formula

π4=2⋅4⋅4⋅6⋅6⋅8⋯3⋅3⋅5⋅5⋅7⋅7⋯

(define (product term a next b)
)
